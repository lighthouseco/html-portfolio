<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
  I am a 25 year old woman starting a family of my own with my husband. Our first son will be here in September, and we are working on building our first home of our own. Currently, I work for a large, private company in the transportation industry and would love to build new skills to be a greater asset to help achieve organizational goals. Also, I have always had entrepreneurial goals, and hope to build my own LLC into a full-time career.

  I have multiple passsions, which can make it hard to remain focused on being the best I can in every field. Right now, there are a lot of things going on in my personal and professional lives. Staying motivated on a day to day basis isn't easy, but I know the kind of life I want to build and am determined to realize my dreams. I cannot do this on my own- my family and friends are a huge support system but my faith is what really keeps me together.

  Without God, I am nothing. He gives me strength, courage, wisdon, patience, and everything good. When I feel lost and hopeless, His light provides comfort and clarity to move forward. I truly believe that my entire life has been blessed because He loves me and I know there have been more prayers prayed for me than I could ever know- by family and friends and friends that are like family. There is no better feeling than basking in His goodness, grace, and love.
